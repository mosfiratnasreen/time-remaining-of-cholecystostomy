# Real-time Prediction of Remaining Duration in Cholecystectomy Surgery

## Overview

This project investigates whether real-time remaining surgery duration (RSD) predictions can enable scrub nurses to anticipate instrument requirements 60 seconds in advance, using the Cholec80 dataset.

**Task A:** Deep learning models for RSD prediction (MLP and BiLSTM), achieving 354.5s MAE.  
**Task B:** Tool anticipation models that integrate predicted timing signals, with ablation studies showing timing becomes essential (+37.2%) during visual occlusion.
